## Mid-Sized Monsters

Welcome to the world of Mid-Sized Monsters! Or MidMon for short - Monsters that can fit inside your briefcase. You play as Arnold who has left home at the age of 30 with the goal of collecting every MidMon in the world. 

## How to Play

Use your capture devices to collect creatures. The weaker they are, the more likely you are to capture them. Summon your collection to fight for you. Throw them potions to heal them as they fight, because if their health reaches zero you will lose them forever.

Explore the procedural world, pick up more coins, potions and capture devices, buy from the shops, and collect all the creatures!

## Design

I had an idea about playing a game from the perspective of a secondary character - like a healer in a dungeon but as a single player game. With the collector theme, it made sense that you'd battle and collect the very things you're supporting (two birds with one stone). At that point it basically became a 'pokemon-like' since they 'own' the idea of capturing creatures and summoning them, so I figured I'd jusct roll with that. If I were to extend it, I'd consider going back to the healer in a dungeon idea!
